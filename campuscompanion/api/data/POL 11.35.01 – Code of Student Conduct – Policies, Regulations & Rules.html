<a id="section-1"></a><h2 class="h5"><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p>All students at North Carolina State University (NC State) are responsible for conducting themselves in a manner that helps enhance an environment of learning in which the rights, dignity, worth, and freedom of each member of the academic community are respected. Violations of campus or University policies, rules or regulations, or federal, state, or local law may result in a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and imposition of sanctions.</p>
<p>This Code of Student Conduct (Code) establishes the expectations for student conduct in the university community. The Code, therefore, proscribes the types of behavior that adversely affects the university community, and the resulting actions that may be taken to both educate students about behavioral expectations and to protect NC State’s community. This Code and its accompanying regulation, <strong><a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/">NCSU REG 11.35.02 &#8211; </a><a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/"><u>Student Discipline Procedures</u></a></strong> describe the process to be followed when a student has been charged with a violation of the Code.</p>
<p>NC State embraces and strives to uphold the freedoms of expression and speech guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the North Carolina Constitution. The university has the right under certain circumstances to regulate the time, place, and manner of exercising these and other constitutionally protected rights.</p>
<a id="section-2"></a><p><strong>2. DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p>The terms defined in the Procedures shall have the same meaning when used in the Code and are incorporated by reference.</p>
<a id="section-3"></a><p><strong>3. AUTHORITY FOR STUDENT DISCIPLINE</strong></p>
<p>The Chancellor has the authority to establish procedures and impose disciplinary action on a student or Student Group/Organization. The Chancellor may delegate such authority to University administrators or other officials.</p>
<a id="section-4"></a><p><strong>4. DEFINITION OF MISCONDUCT</strong></p>
<p>The definition of misconduct at NC State is set forth in this Code in order to give students general notice of prohibited conduct and is not designed to define misconduct in exhaustive terms.</p>
<a id="section-5"></a><p><strong>5. SCOPE</strong></p>
<a id="section-5-1"></a><p><u>5.1 Locations Covered</u></p>
<p>Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Code applies to conduct that occurs on University Premises, in University programs and activities, and to off-campus conduct (whether in NC, another state or a foreign country) that adversely affects the university community, its mission, programs, the pursuit of its objectives, or poses a serious risk of danger to, or disruption or interference with, a member of the university community. The Vice Chancellor and Dean of Academic and Student Affairs shall determine whether the Code applies to off-campus conduct.</p>
<a id="section-5-2"></a><p><u>5.2 Persons Covered</u></p>
<p>The Code applies to all students as defined in the Procedures. The university may initiate a disciplinary action against a student alleged to have violated the Code or other applicable University policies, regulations or rules, or federal, state or local law regardless of the actions taken by civil or criminal authorities or private litigants. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, this Code also applies to students outside a specific term, such as summer, and may cover those not currently enrolled but still eligible to seek a degree.</p>
<a id="section-5-3"></a><p><u>5.3 Violations of Law and Disciplinary Action</u></p>
<p>Students may be accountable to the university and/or to criminal or civil authorities for acts that constitute violations of law and of this Code. The university has the right to proceed with its disciplinary procedures regardless of whether a criminal investigation/charges are pending and regardless of whether criminal charges involving the same incident have been dismissed, resolved, or reduced. However, a student who faces criminal charges or is the subject of a criminal investigation, may temporarily defer Student Conduct proceedings while the criminal matter is pending.  In such a circumstance, the student may be subject to  certain interim actions  intended to protect the campus community during the pendency of criminal proceedings. The interim actions will be determined by the Director without a hearing or a ruling on the charges under the Code and could include an interim suspension and/or removal from University housing facilities.</p>
<a id="section-5-4"></a><p><u>5.4 Student Groups or Organizations</u></p>
<a id="section-5-4-1"></a><p>5.4.1 A Student Group/Organization and its officers may be held collectively or individually responsible for violations of the Code. Student groups/organizations may be charged with violations of the Code without regard to whether members of such groups/organizations are individually charged with violations arising from the same incident.</p>
<a id="section-5-4-2"></a><p>5.4.2 A position of leadership in a Student Group/Organization comes with an expectation of responsibility. Student officers or leaders cannot knowingly permit, condone or acquiesce in any violation of the Code by the group/organization.</p>
<a id="section-5-4-3"></a><p>5.4.3 The officers or leaders or any identifiable representative for a Student Group/Organization may be required by the Director to take appropriate action designed to address the violation of the Code or to prevent its recurrence by the Student Group/Organization. Failure to comply with the Director’s directive shall be considered a violation of the Code, both by the officers, leaders, or representative for the Student Group/Organization and by the Student Group/Organization itself.</p>
<a id="section-5-4-4"></a><p>5.4.4 The procedures outlining the process for responding to alleged violations by Student Groups/Organizations can be found in <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/"><strong><u>NCSU REG11.35.02 – Student Discipline Procedures</u></strong></a>.</p>
<a id="section-5-5"></a><p><u>5.5 Additional Standards</u></p>
<p>Students in certain categories may also be subject to other University behavioral standards. For example, students who are enrolled in the Graduate School, the College of Veterinary Medicine, student athletes, ROTC, or students who live in university housing may be subject to additional standards of behavior.</p>
<a id="section-5-6"></a><p><u>5.6 Howl for Help: Health and Safety Intervention</u></p>
<p>The university encourages students to engage in responsible bystander behaviors. In cases of intoxication, overdose, and/or alcohol poisoning, the university’s primary concern is the health and safety of those involved. No student seeking medical treatment for an alcohol or other drug overdose will be charged with specific violations of the Code related to the possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages or drugs. The procedures outlining the Howl for Help: Health and Safety Intervention process can be found in <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/"><strong><u>NCSU REG11.35.02 – Student Discipline Procedures</u></strong></a>.</p>
<a id="section-6"></a><p><strong>6. STANDARDS OF CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR</strong></p>
<p>The primary responsibility for managing the classroom environment, whether in-person or online, rests with the faculty. Students who engage in any unlawful acts or behaviors which result in disruption of a class, may be directed by the faculty member or University Police to leave the class for the remainder of the class period. If a disruptive student refuses to leave when the faculty member tells them to do so, the faculty member should call University Police to remove the student. This provision regarding classroom behavior is not to be used to punish students with differing academic interpretations of course content or viewpoint, but to address behavior that is disruptive within the educational environment, including impact to other students.</p>
<a id="section-7"></a><p><strong>7. REPORTS OF MISCONDUCT</strong></p>
<a id="section-7-1"></a><p>7.1 Any person may report alleged misconduct by a student or a Student Group/Organization to the Office of Student Conduct.  Misconduct should be reported in as timely a manner as possible. Failure to report misconduct in a timely manner can affect the ability to gather the information needed to assess whether the conduct would constitute a violation of the Code and to support the filing of a charge pursuant to the Code. In some cases, a delay in reporting may result in no charges being filed against the student or Student Group/Organization.</p>
<a id="section-7-2"></a><p>7.2 Misconduct by a student or a Student Group/Organization occurring within university housing facilities should be reported to University Housing.</p>
<a id="section-7-3"></a><p>7.3 Unless otherwise prohibited by law, persons wishing to withdraw a report of misconduct against a student or Student Group/Organization must do so in writing. The university specifically reserves the right to pursue charges against a student or Student Group/Organization for violations of the Code that threaten the safety or well-being of the campus community, constitute violent behavior as defined in <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-04-05-02/"><strong><u>NCSU REG04.05.02 – Campus/Workplace Violence Prevention and Management</u></strong></a>, or any other behavior that adversely affects the university or its educational programs or mission.</p>
<a id="section-8"></a><p><strong>8. ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT</strong></p>
<p>All members of the University community, students, faculty and other employees, have the responsibility to report Academic Misconduct to the appropriate authority.</p>
<p>Faculty members must undertake a threshold responsibility for such traditional safeguards as examination security and proctoring and should clearly communicate their academic expectations in the course syllabus. The use of the Pack Pledge, “I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment,” on all syllabi, assignments, examinations, or other academic evaluations is encouraged. Similarly, faculty members should familiarize themselves with the procedures for addressing Academic Misconduct. The procedures for reporting Academic Misconduct can be found in <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/"><strong><u>NCSU REG11.35.02 – Student Discipline Procedures</u></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Definitions regarding Academic Misconduct are set forth in writing in order to give students general notice of prohibited conduct. They should be read broadly and are not designed to define Academic Misconduct in exhaustive terms. Attempts to commit acts prohibited by the Code may also be addressed through the conduct process. If a student is in doubt regarding any matter relating to the standards of academic integrity in a given course or on a given assignment, that student must consult with the faculty member responsible for the course before presenting the work.</p>
<a id="section-8-1"></a><p><u>8.1 Aiding and Abetting</u></p>
<p>Aiding and abetting others to cheat or plagiarize is as detrimental to the scholarly community as engaging in the acts themselves. Aiding and abetting others to cheat or plagiarize includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>(a) Giving unauthorized assistance to another or others during a test or evaluation;</p>
<p>(b) Posing as another student in order to meet a course or graduation requirement;</p>
<p>(c) Providing specific information about a recently given test, examination, or assignment to a student who thereby gains an unfair advantage in an academic evaluation;</p>
<p>(d) Providing aid to another person, knowing such aid is expressly prohibited by the faculty member, in the research, preparation, creation, writing, performing, or publication of work to be submitted for academic evaluation;</p>
<p>(e) Permitting one’s academic work to be represented as the work of another; or</p>
<p>(f) Sharing or distributing academic materials, including class notes, in violation of the <a href="https://www.northcarolina.edu/apps/policy/index.php?section=500.2"><strong><u>UNC Policy Manual 500.2 – Patent and Copyright Policies</u></strong></a> or <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-01-25-02"><strong><u>NCSU REG01.25.02 – Copyright Infringement – Policy Statement</u></strong></a>.</p>
<a id="section-8-2"></a><p><u>8.2 Cheating</u></p>
<p>Cheating is the giving, taking, or presenting of information or material by a student that unethically or fraudulently aids oneself or another person on any work which is to be considered in the determination of a grade or the completion of academic requirements or the enhancement of that student’s record or Academic Career. Cheating includes, but is not limited, to the following actions:</p>
<p>(a) Copying from someone else’s assignment, examination, or other academic exercise;</p>
<p>(b) Possessing, buying, selling, removing, receiving, or using, at any time or in any manner not prescribed by the faculty member, any information related to an instrument of academic evaluation;</p>
<p>(c) Using materials, equipment, or assistance in connection with an assignment, examination, or other academic exercise which have not been authorized by the faculty member, including but not limited to, notes, calculator, or other technology;</p>
<p>(d) Obtaining or attempting to obtain, in a dishonest manner, any material relating to a student’s academic work;</p>
<p>(e) Working with another or others in completing an assignment, examination, or other academic exercise when the faculty member has required independent and unaided action;</p>
<p>(f) Attempting to influence or change an academic evaluation, grade, or record by unfair means;</p>
<p>(g) Permitting another individual to substitute for one’s self in an academic evaluation;</p>
<p>(h) Marking or submitting an examination or evaluation material in a manner designed to deceive the grading system;</p>
<p>(i) Failing to comply with a specific condition of academic integrity which has been clearly announced in a particular course;</p>
<p>(j) Submitting, without prior permission of the faculty member, any work by a student which has at any time been submitted in identical or similar form by that student in fulfillment of any other academic requirement at any institution;</p>
<p>(k) Submitting of material in whole or part for academic evaluation that has been prepared by another individual(s);</p>
<p>(l) Submitting data which have been altered or contrived in such a way as to be deliberately misleading; or</p>
<p>(m) Providing false information to the University in any manner to achieve an unfair advantage, enhance one’s record, or complete a requirement.</p>
<a id="section-8-3"></a><p><u>8.3 Destruction or Removal of Academic Materials</u></p>
<p>The destruction or removal of academic materials denies access to, and prevents the ability to develop the full potential of, scholarly resources. Prohibited acts under this section include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>(a) Removing or attempting to remove, destroy, steal, or make inaccessible library or other academic material without authorization; or</p>
<p>(b) Willfully damaging the academic work or efforts of another.</p>
<a id="section-8-4"></a><p><u>8.4 Plagiarism</u></p>
<p>Plagiarism is the use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another and the representation of the other’s work as their own. The act of submitting work for evaluation or to meet a requirement is regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own thought and study, produced without assistance, and stated in that student’s own words, except as quotation marks, references, or footnotes acknowledge the use of other sources. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully and correctly acknowledged. Submission of work used previously must first be approved by the faculty member. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited, to the following actions:</p>
<p>(a) Representing the work of others as their own; or</p>
<p>(b) Submitting written materials without proper attribution or acknowledgment of the source.</p>
<a id="section-9"></a><p><strong>9. SANCTIONS FOR ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT</strong></p>
<p>Sanctions for Academic Misconduct result in the creation of a disciplinary file for individuals or groups. Sanctions are imposed to:</p>
<p>(a) Define a student or organization’s status at the university following a finding of responsible for a violation;</p>
<p>(b) Serve as a clear statement about University standards and expectations;</p>
<p>(c) Educate students on the effects of their behavior; and</p>
<p>(d) Attempt to affect a change in that behavior in the future.</p>
<p>Academic misconduct that involves advance planning, collaboration, falsification of papers, forms or documents, actual or potential harm to other students, or other aggravating circumstances may result in suspension or expulsion from the university. In addition, a student may be suspended (or expelled) if further Academic Misconduct is committed while they are on academic integrity probation. Factors or circumstances affecting sanctions shall be considered on a case by case basis.</p>
<a id="section-9-1"></a><p><u>9.1 Academic Integrity Probation</u></p>
<p>A student found responsible for Academic Misconduct may be placed on academic integrity probation for the remainder of the student’s Academic Career. In addition, one or more of the sanctions listed below may be imposed.</p>
<a id="section-9-2"></a><p><u>9.2 Reduction in Grade</u></p>
<p>A reduction in grade on the assignment, examination, or academic exercise on which the violation occurred.</p>
<a id="section-9-3"></a><p><u>9.3 No Credit</u></p>
<p>No credit on the assignment, examination, or academic exercise on which the violation occurred, and/or no credit for the course.</p>
<a id="section-9-4"></a><p><u>9.4 Educational Exercises</u></p>
<p>Participation in an educational exercise regarding academic integrity.</p>
<a id="section-9-5"></a><p><u>9.5 Suspension</u></p>
<p>Suspension is a separation from the university for a specified period of time, after which the student may be eligible to return. While suspended, the student shall not participate in any University Program or Activity and will be trespassed from University Premises. Exceptions to this trespass may be granted by the Director of the Office of Student Conduct based on the written petition of the student and for good cause. In cases where the student will complete graduation requirements during the current semester, suspension may take effect immediately, or at the Hearing Officer’s determination. In addition, graduating students may have a disciplinary notation placed on their transcript or have their transcript withheld for the period of the suspension. In cases where a student will complete graduation requirements in either summer session I or II, the suspension period may include both summer sessions. Notations of the suspension will appear on the student’s transcript. Suspension notations on transcripts may be removed at a later date upon student petition to the Vice Chancellor and Dean of Academic and Student Affairs. However, a disciplinary file indicating suspension will be maintained by the Office of Student Conduct on a permanent basis. The student’s name will be included in the UNC system database for suspended/expelled students.</p>
<a id="section-9-6"></a><p><u>9.6 Expulsion</u></p>
<p>Expulsion may be imposed in the most severe cases of Academic Misconduct. Expulsion is a recommendation that must be approved by the Vice Chancellor and Dean of Academic and Student Affairs and is the permanent separation of the student from the university, unless at a later date the Chancellor concludes on the basis of the former student’s petition and any supportive documentation that they should be approved for reinstatement at NC State. When expelled, the student shall no longer participate in any University Program or Activity and will be trespassed from University Premises. A disciplinary file indicating expulsion will be maintained by the Office of Student Conduct on a permanent basis and will result in a permanent transcript notation. The student’s name will be included in the UNC system database for suspended/expelled students. Expulsion precludes enrollment at any UNC constituent institution.</p>
<a id="section-9-7"></a><p><u>9.7 Additional Sanctions</u></p>
<p>Additional sanctions not listed above may be imposed. These include, but are not limited to, behavioral assessments, research and reflective writing assignments, as well as other non-academic sanctions listed in the Code. For graduate students, in addition to the sanctions imposed above, other sanctions may apply if the Dean of the Graduate School or the Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, as applicable, determines that the graduate student is subject to the policies and procedures established for the Graduate School or the College of Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<a id="section-10"></a><p><strong>10. NON-ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT</strong></p>
<p>Behavior that is subject to disciplinary action under the Code includes alleged violations of federal, state or local law that threaten the safety or well-being of the campus community, any act that constitutes violent behavior as defined in <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-04-05-02/"><strong><u>NCSU REG04.05.02 – Campus/Workplace Violence Prevention and Management</u></strong></a>, and any other behavior that adversely affects the University or its educational programs or mission. Attempts to commit acts prohibited by the Code may also be addressed through the conduct process. All members of the university community, students, faculty and other employees, have the responsibility to report non-Academic Misconduct.</p>
<p>Examples of behavior that will be subject to disciplinary action include:</p>
